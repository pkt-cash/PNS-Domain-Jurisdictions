OVERVIEW

WHOIS is a query and response protocol that is widely used for querying
databases that store the registered users or assignees of an Internet
resource, such as a domain name, an IP address block, or an autonomous
system, but is also used for a wider range of other information. The
protocol stores and delivers database content in a human-readable
format. The Whois protocol is documented in RFC 3912.

The WHOIS server at whois.centralnicregistry.com on TCP port 43 will return
information on the following objects held in CentralNic's registry
system:

  * domain names
  * host servers
  * registrars

QUERYING

By default, CentralNic's WHOIS server assumes all input strings are
domain names, and will attempt to return a WHOIS record for the given
domain. To query for other object types, prefix the object identifier
with "contact", "nameserver" or "registrar", for example:

  $ whois -h whois.centralnicregistry.com "nameserver ns0.example.uk.com"

The above query will return the WHOIS record for the host server
"ns0.example.uk.com".

  $ whois -h whois.centralnicregistry.com "registrar CentralNic Ltd"

The above query will return the WHOIS record for the registrar
"CentralNic Ltd". You can also query for registrars by and IANA ID.

CHARACTER ENCODING

All input is assumed to be encoded in UTF-8. All output is encoded in
UTF-8.

The WHOIS server is IDN-aware, and will accept queries for both the
U-label (ie cafÃ©.uk.com) or the A-label (xn--caf-dma.uk.com).
