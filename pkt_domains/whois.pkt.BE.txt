% The WHOIS service offered by DNS Belgium and the access to the records in the DNS Belgium

% persons to check whether a specific domain name is still available or not
% and to obtain information related to the registration records of
% existing domain names.

% DNS Belgium cannot, under any circumstances, be held liable where the stored
% information would prove to be incomplete or inaccurate in any sense.

%     commercial advertising or other solicitations whether via email or otherwise;
%   - target advertising in any possible way;
%   - to cause nuisance in any possible way to the domain name holders by sending 
%     messages to them (whether by automated, electronic processes capable of
%     enabling high volumes or other possible means).
